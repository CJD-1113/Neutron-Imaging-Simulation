<h1> Neutron-Imaging-Simulation </h1>
<hr>
<p> Project made by Catherine Dickstein and Jack Szprowski <br> For the UMD Radiation Facility <br> In Order To Simulate The Flux That Would Occur In Neutron Imaging </p>

<br>
<h3> Description </h3>
<p> The main_sim.py file can be used to simulate the amount of flux going through a bronze cylinder. The program was developed in order to gather data for an experiment on the porosity of 3d printed metals. The program gave us data on the amount of attenuation of neutrons from the neutron imager for a fully solid bronze cylinder. So that when we imaged 3d printed bronze cylinders we could compare the attenuation of it to the simulation. We used used OpenMC to do this as it is open source and easy to run locally. </p>

<h3> How To Run </h3>
<p> We used <a href="https://github.com/fusion-energy/neutronics-workshop"> Neutronics Workshop </a> in order to run OpenMC in jupiter notebooks with docker. There are other ways to do this, which are listed <a href="https://docs.openmc.org/en/stable/quickinstall.html"> here on the OpenMC documentation </a> </p>
